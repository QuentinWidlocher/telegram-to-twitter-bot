This bot is a simple Twitter bot that can be used to send message to Twitter *and* a Telegram channel at the same time.
You can send text, images, gifs and videos (don't send anything too big though)

First you'll need to connect your Twitter account, then you'll need to link this bot to a Telegram channel.
When everything is in place, just send your message here and it'll be synced to your Twitter account *and* your Telegram channel.
